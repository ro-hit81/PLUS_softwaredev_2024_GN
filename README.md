This repository is for practising the GitHub Flow. It will be used in the course Software Development - Practice (Python).

Hello, my name is Gernot!

## Update from Rohit

### Introduction
In this update, I've added two new files to the repository: a notebook file and a Python file.

### Usage of Notebook and Python Files
I typically use Jupyter Notebook to test my code. Whenever I have an idea or want to experiment with code, I first create a Python notebook and try out my ideas there. Once I'm satisfied with the results, I transfer the code to a Python file for further development or production use.

#### Running Python Files
You can run Python files (`.py`) using the Python terminal as follows:

1. **Navigate to the Folder:**
   Open a terminal and go to the folder containing the `.py` file.

2. **Run the File:**
   Use the following command to execute the Python file:
    `rohitSecrets.py`
